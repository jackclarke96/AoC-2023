Part 2 is significantly more complex - the string can become 100+ characters long. each '?' can have 2 possible states so 2^50+ options... not feasible to brute force.

Seems like this requires either a state machine with Deterministic Finite Automaton/ Non Deterministic Finite Automaton

OR 

Dynamic programming,.

Need to go learn both.
