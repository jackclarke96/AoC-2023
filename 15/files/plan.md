# Part 1

Very straight forward. I can just split the input ByteSlice into smaller byteslices by splitting on each comma in the input.

After that just perfrom the algorthim for each input and sum.

"Increase the current value by the ASCII code you just determined.
Set the current value to itself multiplied by 17.
Set the current value to the remainder of dividing itself by 256."
